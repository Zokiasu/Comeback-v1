# Comeback v1

This project was initially thought in order to be able to follow and list the recent releases of an artist list, because when you start following more than a hundred artists it is difficult to follow each of their releases on multiple networks or tools.
So it uses the information sharing of the fan communities to warn in advance the releases announced on the multiple networks of the artists. The addition of new artists with the appropriate information allows the system to automatically inform the album releases so that users do not miss any more album releases of their favorite artists.
